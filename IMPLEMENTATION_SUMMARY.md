#### Frontend UI (40% Complete)
- **Authentication Screens**: Login/register UI screens (no backend integration)
- **Navigation Structure**: React Navigation framework setup
- **Basic Components**: UI components exist but lack functionality
- **Development Setup**: Expo configuration working

## ‚ùå MAJOR MISSING COMPONENTS (75% of Project)

### Backend Critical Missing
- **Data Import Pipeline**: No Tatoeba/Anki sentence processing
- **Japanese Language Processing**: No furigana generation, JLPT classification
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**: No learning algorithm implementation
- **Learning Session Management**: No progress tracking logic
- **Voice Processing Backend**: No TTS/STT services
- **OCR Implementation**: Mock endpoints only, no actual image processing
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Many database operations incomplete
- **Production Error Handling**: Basic error states only

### Frontend Critical Missing
- **Backend Integration**: No actual API calls, all mock data
- **Learning Interface**: No flashcard system or practice modes
- **Voice Components**: No recording, playback, or pronunciation features
- **Progress Tracking**: No learning statistics or progress visualization
- **Japanese Text Display**: No furigana or proper kanji support
- **Session Management**: No learning session flow

### Infrastructure Missing
- **Production Deployment**: Docker configs incomplete for real deployment
- **Real Database Content**: No production data import or content management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Limited test coverage, no integration testing
- **Performance Optimization**: No optimization, caching, or scaling considerations

## üìã CURRENT NEXT STEPS (Immediate 4-8 weeks)

### Priority 1: Complete Authentication

- Connect frontend login/register to backend
- Test end-to-end authentication flow
- Implement proper error handling

### Priority 2: Basic Learning Foundation  
- Create simple flashcard system
- Implement basic progress tracking
- Add Japanese sentence storage
- Build data import pipeline for Tatoeba

### Priority 3: Frontend-Backend Integration
- Replace all mock data with real API calls
- Implement loading states and error handling
- Add basic learning interface functionality
- Test all API endpoints with frontend

## üí° DEVELOPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Focus Areas
1. **Complete One Feature at a Time**: Don't start new features until existing ones work end-to-end
2. **Test Continuously**: Verify all claimed functionality actually works
3. **Start Simple**: Build basic versions before adding complexity
4. **Document Honestly**: Base documentation on actual working code, not plans

### Technical Priorities
1. **Backend-First Development**: Complete backend features before frontend integration
2. **Data Pipeline**: Establish Japanese content processing early
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Build comprehensive testing from the beginning
4. **Incremental Deployment**: Set up deployment pipeline early for continuous testing

## üö® PERMANENT REALITY CHECK

**Key Metric**: Until users can actually learn Japanese vocabulary using this app, it is not functional regardless of individual component completion.

**Current Status**: Foundation complete (~25%), requires 6+ months of intensive development for MVP, 12+ months for full-featured application.

**Next Milestone**: Working authentication + basic flashcard system (8-12 weeks minimum)
